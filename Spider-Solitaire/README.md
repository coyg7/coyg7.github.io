# Spider-Solitaire

Just a simple remake of classic Spider Solitaire game built during 6-week internship program at Leapfrog Technology Inc.  
The project utilizes vanilla Javascript and HTML canvas for animations.

The [latest version of the game](http://coyg7.github.io/Spider-Solitaire/) is hosted on http://coyg7.github.io/Spider-Solitaire. 

Have fun!
