# Spider-Solitaire

Just a simple remake of classic Spider Solitaire game built during 6-week internship program at Leapfrog Technology Inc.  
The project utilizes vanilla Javascript and HTML canvas for animations.

The latest version of the game is hosted on github. Click here to [Play](http://coyg7.github.io/Spider-Solitaire/)!! :D 

## How to Play
The goal of this game is to arrange all of your cards of the same suit into columns from King to Ace. Once you arrange a column like that, it will append to the bottom left corner of your screen. 

You can move cards between columns by dragging them. When moving cards, you can either move one cardrd off the top of a pile, or several cards (as long as they go in descending order).

If you click on the cards in the bottom right of the screen, a new card will be added to every column. Then you can use those new cards to your advantage. When there are no remaining cards, you win!
